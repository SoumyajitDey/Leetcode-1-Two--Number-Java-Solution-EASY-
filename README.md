# Leetcode-1-Two--Number-Java-Solution-EASY-
Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.  You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.  Example:  Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,  Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9, return [0, 1].Connect Me ON: Linkedin:https://www.linkedin.com/in/soumyajit-dey-a07596158/ Github: https://github.com/SoumyajitDey
